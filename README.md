To begin, you'll need to clone the app from this [repository](https://github.com/yuxinli915/SD-260_FinalProject_MITTFLIX)

All the HTML and CSS is already included in `App.js` and `index.css` files. You'll need to perform an `npm install` to install all the packages necessary to run the application. 

## To start this app

To start this app, you will need to run 2 separate commands.

### `npm run db`

This will start the database so your app actually has movies to query.<br>
The database runs on port `3001` just in case you need that info.

### `npm start`

This starts up the actual app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
